# LINE-FOLLOWER-ROBOT
This project is a simple line follower robot built using the e-Gizmo PBOT2018 platform. It uses three line sensors to detect and follow a black line on a white surface. The robot adjusts its movement in real-time based on sensor readingsâ€”moving forward, turning left or right, or reversing when necessary.

# LINE-FOLLOWER-ROBOT
This Arduino-based project enables a robot to autonomously follow a black line using three optical sensors. It is programmed using the eGizmo_PBOT2018.h library, which handles the PBOT-specific hardware. The code reads sensor inputs and changes the motor direction accordingly using modular functions for forward, left turn, right turn, reverse, and stop.
